## 1.1 Project Definition

The project involves developing an information system to improve the operations of a major travel company's Call Management Centre (CMC). At current state there, the lack of an information system means that a lot of the functions are done manually and at an ad-hoc pace effecting the call flow rate. 

This proposal will uncover how an improved call routing and dynamic call flow system can better used to achieve CMC's business goals by streamlining business processes to increase overall efficiency. The report will examine the five phases of design thinking principles to develop and test the system, the illustration of agile methodology and the assumptions required to develop the system prototype. Further to that a critical evaluation will be completed to provide a comparison highlighting competitive advantages that will accompany the implentation of the new information system. 

## 1.2 Project Objectives

* To create an information system the system should have the capitablity to adjust the call flow rate and direct customers to suitable Relationship Managers (RM)
* To ensure improved call routing adn dynamic call flow control the information system should provide assistance to RMs in serving their end customers by matching RMs and customers according to RMs skills and the customer profiles 
* Another way to improve call flow rate will be to match customers needs to an RM based on performance and product knowledge 


## 2 Stakeholders

There are three main stakeholders that have been identified.
1. Customer  
2. Relationship Manager
3. Manager of all the Relationship Managers

## 3 Approach from a Design Thinking Perspective

Each phase of design thinking will be analysed closely to provide a better understanding on how the individual phases assist in reducing and resolving issues related to developing the CMC information system.  

# 1.Empathise 
Allows for the understanding of user’s pain points and potential improvements that will be required to be developed in order to enhance the user experience. A method to approaching this phase requires the need of interacting with users and considering their viewpoint on the issue. From the interviews conducted, an empathy map was created to provide visualization on user’s attitude and behaviours. This will assist the UX team in revealing any in the current user data and support the greater understanding of end users. 

# 2.Define 
From the data gathered, it will allow for better exploration and understanding into the core problems identified by users. The overall problem definition consists of – “A major travel company would like to develop an information system to improve the operation
of their in-house call management centre (CMC)”. With these details, the system designers/developers are able to envision the functions, features and other elements of the system, which will assist in solving the defined problem.

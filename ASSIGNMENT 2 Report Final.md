## 1.1 Project Definition

The project involves developing an information system to improve the operations of a major travel company's Call Management Centre (CMC). At current state there, the lack of an information system means that a lot of the functions are done manually and at an ad-hoc pace effecting the call flow rate. 

This proposal will uncover how an improved call routing and dynamic call flow system can better used to achieve CMC's business goals by streamlining business processes to increase overall efficiency. The report will examine the five phases of design thinking principles to develop and test the system, the illustration of agile methodology and the assumptions required to develop the system prototype. Further to that a critical evaluation will be completed to provide a comparison highlighting competitive advantages that will accompany the implentation of the new information system. 

## 1.2 Project Objectives

The project objective is to create an information system that meets the following criteria: 
* improves the operations of the in-house call management centre
* has the capability to adjust the call flow rate to suitable relationship managers (RM)
* improves call routing and dynamic flow for both inbound and outbound calls
* directs customers to suitable Relationship Managers (RM) by matching customers to a relationship manager based on performance, product knowledge and customer profiles
* reduces customer's waiting time with the Automatic Call Distributor routing the call to a relationship manager that best matches and has the appropriate skill levels.
* targets potential buyers with outbound calls through automatically dialling numbers according to a customer target list generated by the system. This will allow the travel company to gain potential customers.
* has repeat customers that are satisfied with their experience with the CMC system

## 2 Stakeholders

There are three main stakeholders that have been identified. 
1. Customer  
2. Relationship Manager
3. Travel Company Owner 

** NOTE: WE NEED TO ADD DESCRIPTIONS WITH THESE IDENTIFICATIONS SAYING WHO THEY ARE**

## 3 Approach from a Design Thinking Perspective

Each phase of design thinking will be analysed closely to provide a better understanding on how the individual phases assist in reducing and resolving issues related to developing the CMC information system.  

### 1.Empathise 
Allows for the understanding of user’s pain points and potential improvements that will be required to be developed in order to enhance the user experience. A method to approaching this phase requires the need of interacting with users and considering their viewpoint on the issue. From the interviews conducted, an empathy map was created to provide visualization on user’s attitude and behaviours. This will assist the UX team in revealing any in the current user data and support the greater understanding of end users. 

### 2.Define 
From the data gathered, it will allow for better exploration and understanding into the core problems identified by users. The overall problem definition consists of – “A major travel company would like to develop an information system to improve the operation
of their in-house call management centre (CMC)”. With these details, the system designers/developers are able to envision the functions, features and other elements of the system, which will assist in solving the defined problem.

How Might We Statements: 

1. How might we find a way to book with customers?

2. How might we improve the operation of the the CMC?

3. How might we improve the skills of the relationship managers to serve customers effectively and efficiently?

4. How might we improve the packages available to customers?

5. How might we improve the way the relationship managers are matched with the customers further?

6. How might we improve the customers' likelihood score to purchase a product/package?

7. How might we improve the operation during busy times?

8. How might we improve the way we approach the customers?

9. How might we improve the operation during times of low levels of customers?

10. How might we ensure that we're able to fulfil all customers orders?

How might we improve the overall customer experience?

### 4. Prototype

### 5. Testing

## 4 Agile Methodology: Scrum
Agile models refers to a group of software development methodologies based on iterative development. The agile methodology that will be useful for the travel company is Scrum. ‘Scrum is an agile process that allows us to focus on delivering the business value in the shortest time.’ (Chandran 2020).  Scrum also involves a self-organising team of product owner, scrum master and development team roles. This team must adapt to changing business and technology needs and ‘accomplish the work without depending on others’. (Chandran 2020)

Through thorough consideration, each group member was assigned one of the three main roles for Scrum: 
1. Product Owner - Areeba
2. Scrum Master - Amna
3. Development Team - Patricia Ann and Ishita

The first phase of the scrum methodology is creation of the prioritised product backlog as shown in the tables below. This product backlog was made by product owner and contains user stories and point of view statements for each of the identified stakeholders.

Agenda for Meeting
 
Topic 1: Assignment 1 Specifications for Prototype

Discussion: 
The ideas we would need to prototype for include:

1. Main menu in which the relationship manager or customer sees when they first login in our system

2. Relationship Management Hiring Process => through questionnaire 
After they fill the questionnaire, they will be put into a Relationship Manager List = employee section in sample. Each record will contain details about the relationship manager with their skill matrix => and then the system uses the skill matrix to match with the customers 

3. Customer sorting and collection: we need a screen for Profiler Tool (creates customer profiles)

-Relationship Management POV
*  there are 2 different options  in the CMC system which are outbound and inbound
*  if they choose outbound, we need a customer list that gets from a database with script/guidelines link next to it => this customer link in the list has a travel package that is recommended to them in the script for that potential customer
EXTRA NOTE: system needs a target list which filters the RM based on the skills and profile

* if they choose inbound, we need a screen that would probably say you matched with this customer based on the skill score 

Customer POV:
* They only have one option which is inbound
*  we need a screen saying finding RM => in the meantime they are rated from 1-10 based on likelihood to purchase
*  if they are rated between 8-10 they would be directly matched with RM based on skills and best match
*  if they are rated lower than that, they would wait longer until the perfect RM is there for them

-Receipt of customer order at the end which details costs of the package the relationship manager sold to them

###### ACTION: 
* Grade system which is based on the score like relationship managers who score 90-100 get A+
* Also once they fill out the relationship manager questionnaire, we can choose whether to progress or reject them based on their score
* We can filter which data we don't need by removing attributes for the details screen
* Our plan is to have same application but the relationship manager and customer have different permissions (what they have access to)

# IDEAS FOR ASSIGNMENT 1:

###### Date: 3 April 2020

<!---This is not final yet.. there might be more ideas to add to this methodology --->

MAIN PART 1: Design Thinking

In a design methodology we have five main steps,we are going to be looking at:
We can get project objectives and problem from step 1 and 2..
1) Emphathise: 
We would have to put it on a proper map but i have written out some ideas.. these are not final though..

Think & Feel:
- Frustration when CMC is busy and the customer has to talk on IVR
- convenience for CMC
- great customer service
- highly skilled RM

Hear:
- "Would you like to be intersted in this travel package?"
- "What dates are you looking to travel?"
- "This package would be perfect for you as it meets your requirements."
- "Sorry a RM is not available right now" <---When the CMC is busy--->
- frustrating.. what is taking so long?

Say & Do:
- calling for best package
- "Hi. I'm looking to go here. What is the best package for me?"
- I saw this package. Is it available?

See:
- RM: answering call, have script and guidelines to cater to customers, have customer details from database, entering details to make a booking

Pain:
- Package I want is not available
- have to call for package
- The RM doesn't make the sale with the customer
- the package is already sold out
- CMC is not answering so I have to hang up the phone

Gain:
- RM knows what type of package I like
- I get the package I want for a good price -> worth my money
- receive confirmation email
- All flights and hotels are sorted ;)

2) Define: 
our main objective is to improve operation of the CMC => basicallly improve the efficiency especially when busy
- main focus is on the inbound calls than outbound calls

3) Ideate:
- makes the team ask questions:
1. How to improve the system?
2. How to ensure customer experience is smooth?
3. How to minimise the failure of not selling? --> for the relationship managers
4. How to make sure RM are skilled sufficient for customers? ---> for the travel company
5. How to streamline these processes?

- maybe we can collaborate with major airlines, price match and bargain
- developing sale and inventory system

4) Prototyping: 
have our screens as if we are customer and as if we are the relationship manager

5) Testing
-We need to have unit testing cases in a table.. 

Main PART 2:SCRUM 
In scrum,
We are going to have 4 major roles:
- Product Owner
- Scrum Master
- Development Team
- Stakeholders: Travel Company, RM, Customers/Clients

I'm not sure if there are more steps since I am not an expert with this agile thing but these are the main steps that i have researched
1. Define a vision
2. Define Product Backlog and Prioritise => in this product backlog, there are user stories similar to what we did in BRM and Intro to Software DEvelopment
3. Define Product Releases
4. Conduct Sprint Planning Meeting
5. Conduct Daily Scrum => for development team to replan the sprint backlog from new discoveries learnt
6. Conduct Sprint Review
